"""
execution/leads/list_leads_overview.py

Read-only query returning an overview row for every lead.
No business logic, no writes, no datetime.now usage.

Schema tables used:
    leads           — base table  (id, name, email, phone)
    course_invites  — left-joined; MAX(sent_at) per lead when multiple invites exist
    course_state    — left-joined; stored computed state (completion_pct,
                      current_section, last_activity_at)

HOT signal rules (mirroring directives/HOT_LEAD_SIGNAL.md):
    - Invite sent (ci.sent_at IS NOT NULL)
    - completion_pct >= HOT_COMPLETION_THRESHOLD
    - last_activity_at within HOT_RECENCY_DAYS of the injected `now`

`now` MUST be provided by the caller; this function never calls datetime.now().
Pass an explicit datetime so tests and workers remain fully deterministic.

    """Return overview rows for all leads, ordered most-recently-active first.

    Joins leads with the latest course invite (if any) and stored course_state
    (if any).  Neither join is required — leads with no invite or no progress
    appear with NULL values for those fields.

    The `is_hot` column is 1 when all three HOT conditions are met:
        - invite sent
        - completion_pct >= HOT_COMPLETION_THRESHOLD (25 %)
        - last_activity_at within HOT_RECENCY_DAYS (7) days of `now`

    Args:
        db_path:  Path to the SQLite file.
        limit:    Maximum rows to return.  Hard-capped at MAX_LIMIT (1000).
        offset:   Row offset for pagination.  Defaults to 0.
        now:      Reference datetime for the HOT recency window.  Must be
                  provided explicitly — this function never calls datetime.now().
                  Raises ValueError when None.
