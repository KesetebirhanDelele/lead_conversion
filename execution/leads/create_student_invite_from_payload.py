execution/leads/create_student_invite_from_payload.py

Business-level intake helper that turns a lead payload into a student invite link.

Calls upsert_lead, then mark_course_invite_sent (which upserts the enrollment
internally), then reads back the token and derives the enrollment_id.

Returns a dict ready for the caller to send as an invite link.

    """Upsert a lead, ensure enrollment, create an invite, and return all IDs + link.

    This is the primary intake path for turning an inbound lead payload into a
    student invite link.  Every sub-operation is idempotent: re-calling with
    the same invite_id will skip the INSERT and return the existing token.

    Args:
        lead_id:   Stable unique identifier for the lead.
        name:      Optional display name; updates an existing lead when supplied.
        email:     Optional email; updates an existing lead when supplied.
        phone:     Optional phone; updates an existing lead when supplied.
        course_id: Course to enroll in.  Defaults to 'FREE_INTRO_AI_V0'.
        invite_id: Stable unique identifier for this invite.  A random ID is
                   generated when omitted; supply a stable ID for idempotency.
        base_url:  Base URL of the student portal, without trailing slash.
                   Defaults to 'http://localhost:8501'.
        db_path:   Path to the SQLite file; defaults to tmp/app.db.
        now:       ISO-8601 UTC string written to generated_at on the invite row.
                   When None, generated_at is left null.  Callers should always
                   supply this value; omitting it is only safe in legacy call
                   sites that have not yet been updated.

    Returns:
        dict with keys:
            lead_id       — the lead identifier (echoed from input)
            course_id     — the course identifier (echoed from input)
            enrollment_id — stable ENR_{lead_id}_{course_id} identifier
            invite_id     — the invite identifier (generated or echoed)
            token         — the URL-safe token stored on the invite row
            invite_link   — f"{base_url}/?token={token}"
