"""
execution/scans/find_completion_finalization_leads.py

Read-only scan for leads that appear ready for finalization.

Selection rule:
- course_state.completion_pct >= 100  (course completed)
- course_state.started_at IS NOT NULL (has a confirmed start)

No writes, no finalization execution, no dispatch.
No persistent finalized flag exists in the current schema —
this scan is a read-only candidate list only.
