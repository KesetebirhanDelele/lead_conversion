execution/ghl/write_ghl_contact_fields.py

Step 4 of the GHL handshake flow (directives/GHL_INTEGRATION.md):

    … → [Step 3 complete] → [Step 4 — this function] → GHL → Step 5 …

Responsibility: build the full canonical GHL custom-field payload for one lead
(via build_ghl_full_field_payload) and POST it to the configured GHL contact-
update endpoint.  No business logic lives here — only payload construction,
contact-ID resolution, and HTTP transport.

GHL contact resolution
----------------------
1. Preferred path — stored ghl_contact_id on the leads row (already embedded in
   the built payload, so no extra DB read is needed).
2. Fallback path — if ghl_contact_id is absent AND a ghl_lookup_url is provided,
   sync_ghl_contact_id is called to resolve and store it before sending.
3. If neither path yields a ghl_contact_id, no HTTP request is made and the
   function returns ok=False.

Safe no-op
----------
When ghl_api_url is None or blank the function returns ok=True, sent=False with
reason="NO_URL".  This mirrors the pattern in dispatch_cory_ghl so callers can
wire configuration gradually without breaking tests or dev environments.
