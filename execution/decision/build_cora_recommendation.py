execution/decision/build_cora_recommendation.py

Builds a structured recommendation event payload for Cora integration (v1).

Rule specification: directives/CORA_RECOMMENDATION_EVENTS.md

Pure function — no database access, no network calls, no datetime.now() calls.
Converts current lead state into a deterministic, explainable outreach payload
that a future Cora worker can consume to trigger the appropriate action.
